# Zsh plugin template

A very compliant seed to grow your ZSH plugin project, whether it be a daisy ðŸŒ¼
or a tree ðŸŒ².

## Using

Fork this repository, replace instances of `plugin-template` with your project
name.
For example, if your project is named `my-awesome-plugin` you could replace file
names and symbols like so:

* `plugin-template` â†’ `my-awesome-plugin`
* `plugin_template` â†’ `my_awesome_plugin`
* `PLUGIN_TEMPLATE` â†’ `MY_AWESOME_PLUGIN`

You can place your custom functions into `functions/` directory and they will
automatically be added to autoload.
The `bin/` directory will be added to `$PATH` automatically.
Any custom data you need can be placed in the `data/` directory, your plugin can
reference it like `${Plugins[MY_AWESOME_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR]}/my-data.txt`.
